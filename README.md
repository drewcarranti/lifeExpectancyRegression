# lifeExpectancyRegression <br />
This was a project for my Statistcics for Quantitative Finance class. We were given data on life expectancy and potential predicitive variables. <br />
We were tasked with developing a predictive regression model that minimized predictive error. We competed against the rest of our year's QF class <br />
our professor. My group came in first place ultimately with the lowest predicitive error. <br />
