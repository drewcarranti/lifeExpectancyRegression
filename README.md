# lifeExpectancyRegression <br />
This was a project for my Statistcics for Quantitative Finance class. We were given data on life expectancy and potential predicitive <br />
variables. We were tasked with developing a predictive regression model that minimized predictive error. We competed against the 
rest of our year's QF class and our professor. My group ultimately came in first place, being beat out only by our Professor.
