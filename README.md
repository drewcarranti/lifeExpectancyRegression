# lifeExpectancyRegression <br />
This was a project for my Statistcics for Quantitative Finance class. We were given data on life expectancy <br />
and potential predicitive variables. We were tasked with developing a predictive regression model that minimized <br />
predictive error. We competed against the rest of our year's QF class and our professor. <br />
My group came in first place ultimately with the lowest predicitive error. <br />
